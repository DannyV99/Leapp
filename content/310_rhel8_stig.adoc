// STIG >> RHEL 8 STIG

STIG remediations listed here are intentionally turned off on the template.  The primary reason for this is they are known to consistently prevent application installations, or post installation operations.  It is expected that they are to be reviewed and remediated as available by the application owner.

| `fapolicy` is a security module with limited toolset to assist with enabling applications.  It is expected that application owners will attempt to install the required module and configure it to work with their application.  Currently it is known to break the majority of applications including most Red Hat based applications without knowing explicit and unique configurations.

| There is a false positive associated with this on SCC scans.  Connecting the sytem to the SOCOM satellite ensures all non-local repositories are compliant and corrects the false positive.

| This was unintentionally skipped, and will be corrected in subsequent updates.  Application owners can correct this, but it may be required for specific applications to be installed without GPG validation.

| RHEL-08-030740

| This is expected to be correct as part of the post-provisioning process

| This is usually a false positive on SCC scans.  Accounts like `acas` which use public key authentication are configured to have their password removed specifically to prevent anyone from accessing the account though any means other than the managed certificate.  Should be manually reviewed by application owner.

| RHEL-08-020210
| II
| The `tempadmin` acount does not expire to esure the account can be used from the template at any time.  This account should be removed as part of post-provisioning.  The `sofadmin` account is a break-glass service account for emergencies.

NOTE: The `tmux` configuration is currently being reviewed for a possible implementation method that meets the intent of the STIG.  This will be reviewed for future versions of the template.

= Recommended for Application installation review

The following STIG items have been applied by default but are historically known to cause issues with application installation.  If an application owner is having issues installing an application it is recommended to review these items first.

| II
| Many applications require the use of `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` for initial installation.  This is expected to be corrected by application owners after installation.

| Many applications installed by `root` assume a default umask of `022` which enables group and world readable access to files and directories.  This can usually be safely corrected after installation if it is identified to be a problem.
